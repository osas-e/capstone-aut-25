# Open WebUI Starter
=====================

The Open WebUI Starter project is meant to provide a quick template for 
setting up [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/). More information can be found 
about configurations on the [Open WebUI Docs](https://docs.openwebui.com/) or the [Gitub repository](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).


## Project Overview

The Open WebUI Starter project is a entry into using the open-source project 
Open WebUI. Open WebUI integrates with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and provides a private, user-friendly, and local interface for interacting with computer intelligence.

## Installation

To install the Open WebUI Starter project, follow these steps:

### Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter.git
```

### Create the environment files

```sh
cp conf/cloudflared/config.example conf/cloudflared/config.yml
cp conf/nginx/default.example conf/nginx/default.conf

cp data/searxng/settings.yml.example data/searxng/settings.yml
cp data/searxng/uwsgi.ini.example data/searxng/uwsgi.ini

cp env/auth.example env/auth.env
cp env/cloudflared.example env/cloudflared.env
cp env/db.example env/db.env
cp env/edgetts.example env/edgetts.env
cp env/ollama.example env/ollama.env
cp env/openwebui.example env/openwebui.env
cp env/redis.example env/redis.env
cp env/searxng.example env/searxng.env
```

*The environment files can contain sensitive information such as API keys 
and passwords. Do not check them into source control.*

### Add a unique SEARXNG_SECRET

Make this change to your searxng environment file [env/searxng.env](http://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/searxng.example#L3). The link provided will lead you to the github repository to read about it.

### Add a unique WEBUI_SECRET_KEY to your environment files

Make this change to your auth environment file [env/auth.env](http://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/auth.example#L2). The link provided will lead you to the github repository to read about it.

Make this change to your openwebui environment file [env/openwebui.env](http://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/openwebui.example#L11).

**Make sure the environment files match**:. This allows jwt token authentication to work with the main Open WebUI (/), swagger (/docs), redis (/redis), and searxng (/searxng)

### Setup Cloudflare

Cloudflare provides a way to point web browsers to a domain name that connects to your local Open WebUI environment. The platform will also setup and provide a free certificate so you can secure your domain name with SSL.

<img src="./images/alert-original.png" alt="Beware Image" width="15" height="15"> **Beware**

One additional point about moving forward without using a proxying platform like Cloudflare. With the right tools, IP addresses can be mapped to a physical location in the real world. If you connect a domain name to your home IP without the use of a proxying platform, it is possible to [DOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing) the location. *It is in your best interest to use a proxy, thus anonymizing the location.*

#### Sign up with a [free account](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/)

Get started using Cloudflare.

<img src="./images/cloudflare-signup.png" alt="Cloudflare Signup" align="center" width="1000">

#### Add a domain for Cloudflare to manage

This allows Cloudflare to receive visitors when they look up your domain in a browser.

<img src="./images/cloudflare-account.png" alt="Cloudflare Account" align="center" width="1000">

#### Configure a Zero Trust Network tunnel

This allows Cloudflare to send visitors to your connected environment (home or otherwise)

<img src="./images/cloudflare-tunnel.png" alt="Cloudflare Tunnel" align="center" width="1000">


### Assign your tunnel id

Update the [conf/cloudflared/config.yml](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/conf/cloudflare/config.example#L1) file with your tunnel id. It can be found located in one of the two red rectangles on the image above.

### Assign your tunnel token

Update the [env/cloudflared.env](http://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/cloudflared.example#L1) file with your token. It can be found in the red rectangle on the image below.

<img src="./images/cloudflare-connector.png" alt="Cloudflare Connector" align="center" width="1000">

### Add your domain name

Update the [conf/nginx/default.conf](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/conf/nginx/default.example#L34) file with your domain name. The link provided will show you the specific line in the file to change.

### Decide on a database

__TL/DR__

The easiest route is to skip this section and use Sqlite. If you want to use Postgresql as a database, follow along below.

__More Detailed__

Uncomment your [env/openwebui.env](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/openwebui.example#L2) file to setup a connection to the locally running db service. To do this, remove the "#" from the beginning of the line.

### Start your docker container environment

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Once the containers are started, access the Open WebUI platform by visiting 
`http://<domain-name>/` in your web browser.



## Additional Setup

### Migrating from Sqlite to Postgresql

If your environment is already setup and you do not want to lose data, follow along below. If this is your initial setup, you can skip this and follow the above instructions on how to [Decide on a database](#decide-on-a-database)

*** Tested using node v22.12.0 ***

Depending on your setup, you may need to expose your postgresql (db) container 
port before proceeding. By default, this project's db container is not exposing 
a port. 

***example***

```yaml
services:
  db:
image: pgvector/pgvector:pg15
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
```

1. Change to the migrator folder and install node packages

```bash
cd migrator
npm install
```

2. Execute migrate.js file with node. Adjust the following command with your 
specific configuration locations, user, password, and database names.

```bash
node migrate.js ../data/openwebui/webui.db "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/openwebui"
```

3. Remove and restart your postgresql container
```bash
docker compose down db && docker compose up db -d
```

### Watchtower and Notifications

A Watchtower container provides a convenient way to check in on your container 
versions to see if updates have been released. Once updates are found, Watchtower 
will pull the latest container image(s), stop the currently running container and 
start a new container based on the new image. After completing its process, 
Watchtower can send notifications to you. More can be found on notifications via 
the [Watchtower website](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/notifications/).

For the sake of simplicity, this document will cover the instructions for setting 
up notifications via Discord. If you desire to be more detailed in your configuration, 
the [arguments section](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/arguments/) describes 
additional settings available for the watchtower setup.

1. Edit your [env/watchtower.env](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/watchtower.example#L2) with your discord link. [More information](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/v0.8/services/discord/) is provided on how to create your discord link (token@webhookid).
2. Restart your watchtower container

```bash
docker compose down watchtower && docker compose up watchtower -d
```
